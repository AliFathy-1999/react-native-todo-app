<!-- ## App Features

- The app allows you to create and manage a list of TODOs.

- On the main screen, you will find two input fields: one for the TODO title and another for the description.

- After entering the TODO details, click the submit button to add the TODO to the list.

- A divider line separates the input section from the TODO list.

- The TODO list is initially filtered to show all the TODOs. You can change the filter by clicking on one of the three buttons: "All", "Active", or "Done".

- Clicking on a TODO in the list marks it as done and displays a line through it.

- You can add, edit, and delete TODOs as needed. -->
